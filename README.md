# Project Brief
The objective of this project was to create an interactive browser based game which incorporates the use of HTML, CSS and Javasctipt.These are the tools learnt over the last couple weeks in preperation for this project.

  # - PLANNING & WIREFRAME
  
The initial plannning was to create a smaller game board for the paddle and the ball. The remaing space within the browser was intended for animation and other features. However technical difficulties occured and rendered the use of a container unsuccesful and difficult. This was overcome by using the full width of the browser. In doing so ..... 




# STAGES 
- SPRINT 1

To create the game the task was splint into two sprints to make it more manageable. 
The intital first sprint included tasks such as :
        - Create a ball and two indidual paddles for either users
        - Allow the users to move up and down
        - Allow the ball to move across the board
        - Once the ball has passed through the left or right side of the board the opposing user will gain a point
        - Provide a minimal viable product (MVP)


- SPRINT 2
  
For the second sprint i was tasked with : 
 - Displaying the score of both users.
 - Display the instructions of the game on the screen
 - Overall providing a more aesthetically pleasing product.
 - Features like using a modal were implemented 
 
 
 
 e.g. I used a modal from bootstrap to display the game instructions using the following code.
 

All of the above tasks were successfully completed.

#  - CHALLENGES 
  
One of the challenges that occurered as mentioned previously was being unable to create a sufficient container for the ball and paddles. Though i overcame this obstable it did restrict the space available to me hence i had to change the design. 

Another challenge that was encountered was including the score of the users , displaying it and using a winning condition to end the game. This took longer than expected because i had diffulty in creating the correct function etc.
